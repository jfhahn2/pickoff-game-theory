In this project, we use game theoretic concepts to analyze the effects of the 2023 MLB rule changes surrounding baserunning. Specifically, we were interested in how the rule limiting pitchers to two disengagements per plate appearance affects the strategies chosen by both teams when a runner reaches first base. There has been very little analysis of leadoff and pickoff decisions, so we wanted to determine optimal strategies for these situations and calculate the value that could be gained here. We came up with a simple rule of thumb that works well in most situations: with each disengagement, runners should extend their leadoff by about two feet in order to maximize the run expectancy for their team.
